            <p>
              Observing Nigeria’s building landscape, 
              it’s clear that demolitions by the government
              have been frequent in recent years, often 
              leaving property owners uncompensated. 
              This highlights the urgent need for accurate 
              land surveys and proper
              documentation to protect your property.

            <p>Another distubing issue is that some of the victims were scammed by so called

            fake survey plans rhat were not registered or fake documents, which is another
            disturbing issue today.
